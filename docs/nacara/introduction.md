Nacara is a static site generator. You write markdown files and let Nacara generate your website for you.

You can easily change how the site looks and feels, and if needed write your own layouts.

## Prerequisites

Nacara requires you to have at least Node.js 12.20, 14.14, or 16.0 because it is using ESM modules.
