Nacara is extensible, you can write your own layout or re-use existing layout to adapt them to your needs.

You can use both **F#** and **JavaScript** to do so.

In general, you should prefer **JavaScript** when adapting an existing layout as it is easier to **interop with the NPM packages**.

If you want to write a complex layout, you should prefer **F#** as it Nacara comes with `Nacara.Core` nuget, which includes all the **types definition** and some **helpers**.
